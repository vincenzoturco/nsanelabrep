#summary DEGG: Dependency Graph Generator for SAP NW 7.0 DCs

= Introduction =

This project provides graphic facilities for inter-DC dependencies detection in SAP NW 7.0 environment.
Requires JRE 1.6.


= Details =

== Startup ==
Copy the executable jar on your local machine. Type on your shell
{{{
#<path_to_your_jre6>/bin/java -jar <path_to_executable_jar>
}}}

== Usage ==
 * Select File->New->NW70 dependency graph.
 * A file chooser pops up: select a root directory. The DC definitions (".dcdef" files) will be recursively searched in the corresponding subtree.
 * Graphics will be generated for the DCs found. DCs are represented as vertices, dependencies as edges. Dependencies derived from the *.dcdef* file are represented as plain edges, labelled with the corresponding public part name. Dependencies derived from the *ProjectProperties.wdProperties* file are represented as dotted edges, with no label.
 * You can now export the generated graph as image from File->Export

= Used Libraries =
  * Jung2 for graph generation and graphics
  * JOX for XML processing
  * Standard Sun DOM implementation for XML processing
